Card
- Wild Card
- Skip Card

General
- Rotate the player who starts


Potential Issues:
- Wild Cards may be abd with matches because of the saving the number thing...
- May need to add a store parameter to the matched function that stores the value if its true
- Then when completing a phase the values are stored...
